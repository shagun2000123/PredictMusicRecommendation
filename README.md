# PredictMusicRecommendation
In this task, we predict the chances of a user listening to a song repetitively after the first observable listening event within a time window was triggered. If there are recurring listening event(s) triggered within a month after the userâ€™s very first observable listening event, its target is marked 1, and 0 otherwise in the training set. The same rule applies to the testing set.
